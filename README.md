# Governance

This repository defines the **governance framework** for the **NeoNephos Katalis** project, part of the [Linux Foundation Europe NeoNephos initiative](https://www.linuxfoundation.eu/).

---

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to ensure that all contributors, members, and stakeholders share a **transparent and common understanding** of how decisions are made, how work is organized, and how the project evolves.

Governance provides:

- **Clarity** on roles, responsibilities, and decision-making processes  
- **Fairness** through open participation and consensus-driven approaches  
- **Accountability** by documenting policies, rules, and procedures  
- **Alignment** with European priorities (IPCEI-CIS, Gaia-X, EU research programs)

---

## Governance Model

The project follows an **open governance model** inspired by Linux Foundation best practices.

- **Steering Committee (SC)**  
  - Responsible for strategic direction, alignment with EU initiatives, and coordination with other projects (e.g., Gardener, OCM, ApeiroRA).  
  - Membership: Representatives from participating organizations.

- **Technical Steering Committee (TSC)**  
  - Oversees technical decisions, architecture specifications, and interoperability efforts.  
  - Membership: Maintainers elected by contributors.

- **Working Groups (WGs)**  
  - Topic-specific groups (e.g., Security, Cloud–Edge Federation, API Standardization).  
  - Open to all contributors.

- **Community**  
  - Contributions are open via pull requests, issues, and discussions.  
  - All technical contributions require **two maintainer approvals** before merging.

## Principles

1. **Openness** – Participation is open to all stakeholders.  
2. **Transparency** – All decisions are documented and accessible.  
3. **Meritocracy** – Influence is earned through contribution.  
4. **Neutrality** – Governance is vendor-neutral, focused on interoperability.  
5. **Security by Design** – Governance ensures compliance with EU standards (e.g., GDPR, NIS2).  

---

## Decision Making

- **Consensus first** – seek agreement in working groups.  
- **Lazy consensus** – silence means consent after 5 business days.  
- **Escalation** – unresolved issues can be raised to the TSC, then the SC.

## Alignment with IPCEI-CIS

This project contributes to the **Important Project of Common European Interest – Cloud Infrastructure and Services (IPCEI-CIS)** by:

- Promoting **open standards** and **API-first interoperability**  
- Building a **secure, cloud–edge continuum**  
- Supporting **sovereign European digital infrastructure**

## How to Engage

- Join discussions in GitHub **Issues** & **Discussions**  
- Propose changes via **Pull Requests**  
- Participate in **Working Groups**  
- Review [Architecture Specs](../Architecture_Specs)
